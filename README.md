This is an attempt to make an agentic ai that will monitor a discord chat and send a prompt to a text generator that will generate parameters to a function that produces the probabilities for the prompted DnD roll.

The function code is original to the main branch, I am hoping to train an AI to generate the parameters needed for the code.
